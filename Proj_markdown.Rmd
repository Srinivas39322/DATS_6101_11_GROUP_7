## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(appData)
head(appData,5)
```
```{r}
numerical_cols <- sapply(appData, is.numeric)
print(numerical_cols)
numerical_data <- df[, numerical_cols]

```
